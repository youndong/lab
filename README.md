# dbus-cxx-example

This project is an example of server and client to deliver messages based on D-Bus using flatbuffers.

To configure dbus-based services, proxy and adaptation header files are created using interface.xml. adapter is required for service (server) implementation, proxy is required for application (client) implementation. 

The following files are automatically generated by some utility tools. So "NEVER" modify it.

    - Generated files by flatc (flatbuffers compiler)
        /src/payload_generated.h 
        
    - Generated files by dbusxx-xml2pp 
        /src/service_adaptor.h
        /src/service_proxy.h
